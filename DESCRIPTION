Description: 'HydroBudget' (HB) is a spatially distributed
    groundwater recharge (GWR) model that computes a superficial water
    budget on grid cells with outputs aggregated into monthly time steps.
    It was developed as an accessible and computationally affordable model
    to simulate GWR over large areas (thousands of km2, regional-scale
    watersheds) and for long time periods (decades), in cold and humid
    climates.
