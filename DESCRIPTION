Description: HydroBudget is a spatially distributed
  groundwater recharge model that computes a superficial water
  budget on grid cells with outputs aggregated into monthly time steps.
  It was developed as an accessible and computationally affordable model
  to simulate groundwater recharge over large areas (thousands of km2,
  regional-scale watersheds) and for long time periods (decades), in cold
  and humid climates. Model algorithms are based on the research of
  Dubois, E. et al. (2021a) <doi:10.5683/SP3/EUDV3H> and 
  Dubois, E. et al. (2021b) <doi:10.5194/hess-25-6567-2021>.
