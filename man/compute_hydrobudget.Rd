\description{
HydroBudget is a spatially distributed GWR model that computes a superficial water budget on
grid cells of regional-scale watersheds. Runoff, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and potential
GWR are simulated for each grid cell, with a monthly time step, and fluxes do not
transfer from a cell to another (no water routing). The model inputs are distributed daily
precipitation and temperature as well as distributed data of pedology, land cover, and slope.
